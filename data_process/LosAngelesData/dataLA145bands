The Los Angeles data set taken over a port in the city of Los Angeles consisted of an LR-HSI and the corresponding HR-PAN image, 
which was obtained by two instruments on the EO-1 satellite, i.e., the Hyperion and the advanced land imager (ALI).
According to the candidate features of the Botswana data set, uncalibrated and noisy spectral bands of the Los Angeles data set were removed, thus leaving 145 bands for experimentation.
The size of the test HSI is 120 × 120 × 145, and the dimension of the experimental PAN image is 360 × 360.
